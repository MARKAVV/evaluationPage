<div class="Div4"> <span class="tit">Maria Callas</span> <span class="tit2">Coloratura Legend</span><span class="sub"> <br><br>
The fame and legacy of Maria Callas are nearly unsurpassed in the modern history of opera. Her fame has transcended the usual boundaries of classical music, and she has been the inspiration for several movies as well as the successful Broadway play "Master Class." Her extensive catalogue of recordings remains among the most coveted and controversial for both her fans and detractors. Though American by birth, Callas (born Maria Anne Sofia Cecilia Kalogeropoulos)was born of Greek parents, and at age 13 her mother took her back to Greece because of financial difficulties caused by the Great Depression. She studied voice at the Royal Acadjemy of Music in Athens with Spanish coloratura soprano Elvira de Hidalgo and made rapid progress; she soon sang Santuzza in a student production of Cavalleria rusticana. Her professional debut came at age... </span><span class="links1"><i>read full biography</i></span></div>

    <h3>Family life, childhood and move to Greece</h3>
    <p>The name on Callas's New York birth certificate is Sophie Cecilia Kalos,although she was christened Maria Anna Cecilia Sofia Kalogeropoulos. She was born at Flower Hospital (now the Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center), 1249 5th Avenue, on December 2, 1923, to Greek parents, George Kalogeropoulos (c. 1881-1972) and Elmina Evangelia "Litsa" née Demes, originally Dimitriadou (c. 1894-1982). Callas's father had shortened the surname Kalogeropoulos first to "Kalos" and subsequently to "Callas" to make it more manageable. George and Litsa Callas were an ill-matched couple from the beginning. George was easy-going and unambitious, with no interest in the arts, while Litsa was vivacious and socially ambitious and had dreamed of a life in the arts, which her middle-class parents had stifled in her childhood and youth.Litsa's father, Petros Dimitriadis (1852-1916), was in failing health when Litsa introduced George to her family. Petros, distrustful of George, had warned his daughter, "You will never be happy with him. If you marry that man, I will never be able to help you". Litsa had ignored his warning, but soon realized that her father was right... <span class="links"><a href="#">read more</a></span></p>
    <p><h3>Early operatic career in Greece</h3>
    <p>After several appearances as a student, Callas began appearing in secondary roles at the Greek National Opera. De Hidalgo was instrumental in securing roles for her, allowing Callas to earn a small salary, which helped her and her family get through the difficult war years. Callas made her professional debut in February 1941, in the small role of Beatrice in Franz von Suppé's Boccaccio. Soprano Galatea Amaxopoulou, who sang in the chorus, later recalled, "Even in rehearsal, Maria's fantastic performing ability had been obvious, and from then on, the others started trying ways of preventing her from appearing."[22] Fellow singer Maria Alkeou similarly recalled that the established sopranos Nafsika Galanou and Anna (Zozó) Remmoundou "used to stand in the wings while Callas was singing and make remarks about her, muttering, laughing, and point their fingers at her". Despite these hostilities, Callas managed to continue and made her debut in a leading role in August 1942 as Tosca, going on to sing the role of Marta in Eugen d'Albert's Tiefland at the Olympia Theatre. Callas's performance as Marta received glowing reviews... <span class="links"><a href="#">read more</a></span></p>

    <h3>Important debuts</h3>
    <p>Although by 1951, Callas had sung at all the major theatres in Italy, she had not yet made her official debut at Italy's most prestigious opera house, <i>Teatro alla Scala</i> in Milan. According to composer <i>Gian Carlo Menotti</i>, Callas had substituted for<i>Renata Tebaldi</i> in the role of <i>"Aida"</i> in 1950, and La Scala's general manager, Antonio Ghiringhelli, had taken an immediate dislike to Callas. Menotti recalls that Ghiringhelli had promised him any singer he wanted for the premiere of <i>The Consul" The Consul</i>, but when he suggested Callas, Ghiringhelli said that he would never have Callas at La Scala except as a guest artist. However, as Callas's fame grew, and especially after her great success in <i>I vespri siciliani</i> in Florence, Ghiringhelli had to relent: Callas made her official debut at La Scala in <i>I vespri siciliani</i> on opening night in December 1951, and this theatre became her artistic home throughout the 1950s. La Scala mounted many new productions specially for Callas by directors such as <i>Herbert von Karajan</i>, <i>Franco Zeffirelli</i> and, most importantly, <i>Luchino Visconti</i>.  Visconti stated later that he... <span class="links"><a href="#">read more</a></span></p>
